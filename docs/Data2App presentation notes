Data2app - ANZ rep (Elma) spoke about data2app component. 
I have put words she definitely used in quotes! 

**Key takeaways**
1. Use "lean start up" approach - complete end-to-end pipeline once, then iterate.
* Perhaps spend 1-2 weeks cleaning and then move on to app development for first iteration
2. Emphasis on "actionable insights" 
* think about how end user will use your product
* end user should be able to share insights with friends on social media
3.  Mention of updates
* I got the impression, they would be impressed with any "live" component, such as live data updates or online learning
4. Strong emphasis on "interpretability" over powerful predictive capability
* Use a good enough model 
* Non machine learners want to understand why a model makes a given prediction, and be given intuition about it
